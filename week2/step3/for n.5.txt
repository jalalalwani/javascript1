Ternary Operator
The ternary operator, also known as the conditional operator, is used as shorthand for an if...else statement.

A ternary operator is written with the syntax of a question mark (?) followed by a colon (:), as demonstrated below.

(condition) ? expression on true : expression on false
In the above statement, the condition is written first, followed by a ?. The first expression will execute on true, and the second expression will execute on false. It is very similar to an if...else statement, with more compact syntax.

In this example, we will create a program that checks if a user is 21 or older. If they are, it will print "You may enter" to the console. If they are not, it will print "You may not enter." to the console.

age.js
// Set age of user
let age = 20;

// Place result of ternary operation in a variable
const oldEnough = (age >= 21) ? "You may enter." : "You may not enter.";

// Print output
oldEnough;
